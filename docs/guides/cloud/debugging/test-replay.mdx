## What Is Test Replay?

Test Replay in Cypress Cloud allows developers to accurately and efficiently debug failed and flaky CI test runs. It captures every detail of test runs, enabling developers to replay and interact with the DOM, inspect network events, and console events as they happened during CI. This eliminates the need to replicate failed tests locally and enhances the ability to debug complex applications with confidence and speed.

## Why Test Replay?

Cypress test failures in CI are currently captured through screenshots, videos, and stack trace outputs, but these artifacts provide limited information. Developers often need more context to understand the root cause of failures, requiring them to reproduce the issue locally, which may not always be possible due to environmental or network conditions. This knowledge gap between test failures and debugging capabilities leads to increased debugging time and potentially deploying unresolved bugs to production.

### How Does Test Replay Advance Your Workflow?

Test Replay complements the existing visual artifacts provided by Cypress Cloud by allowing developers to directly interact with tests as they occurred in CI. It eliminates the need for local test replication by enabling developers to time-travel to the exact moment of test failure, replaying and interacting with network requests, console logs, JavaScript errors, and element rendering. With Test Replay, developers gain access to previously inaccessible details and feedback loops, enabling faster and more accurate debugging, and instilling confidence in handling test failures in CI. This allows for improved test runtimes by replacing video recordings with Test Replay, which provides a superior debugging experience.

## Getting Started

:::info

&#8239<Icon name="check-circle" /> Test Replay is available to **all** Cypress Cloud plans at no additional cost, subject to usage limits. Free plans allow up to 500 test results per month, while exceeding this limit requires upgrading the plan.

:::

Test Replay is automatically enabled when updating to `v13` of Cypress and an opt-out is provided through project-level settings. Learn about what this means for [capturing video of test failure](#See-also) in Cypress Cloud below.

All you need to do is log into your Cypress Cloud account without requiring any additional software or changes to the existing test run recording process.

## Accessing Test Replay

Accessing the replay of your test run in CI is as simple as reviewing any other test artifact in Cypress Cloud.

1. Hover on a "Test for review" under the Latest Runs Overview.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/cloud/test-replay/test-overview.jpg"
  alt="Run overview row"
/>

2. Or navigate to the [test detail sidebar](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Test-detail-sidebar) header or above each attempt in the errors panel.

<DocsImage src="/img/guides/cloud/test-replay/sidebar.jpg" alt="Run sidebar" />

## Debugging With Test Replay

Both options above display the Test Replay interface, which we'll unpack from top to bottom in more detail below.

  alt="Test Replay Demo"
/>

### Run header

The left side of the header displays the Cypress Cloud test _run number_ with the Git branch name along with spec, platform and browser information. Hovering on this exposes additional test meta data.

  alt="Test Replay header"
/>

### Command Log

The left side of the screen displays the familiar command log, where you can review and interact with your test just like you would in the Cypress App.

  alt="Test Replay Developer Tools panel"

/>

### Developer Tools

Dive into network-level traffic, console events and inspect the application under test just as you can in the browser.

<DocsImage

  alt="Test Replay Developer Tools panel"
  width="60%"
/>

### Replay Controls

Toggle each test attempt, play back errors at a variety of speeds or scrub through the captured error by dragging the playhead along the timeline.

## Browser Compatibility

Test Replay currently supports Chromium-based browsers only. Additionally, Cypress Cloud allows running Cypress for a single browser per group definer. For example, Firefox tests require video recording, while Chrome tests can utilize Test Replay.
